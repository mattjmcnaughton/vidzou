# [WIP] web-youtube-dl

## WIP

Many aspects of this project are still a work in progress. Among the most
important are:

- Deciding on a name/hosting strategy.
- Documentation is sporadic...
  - Some aspects of the code are very well documented (i.e. the youtube-dl
    Dockerfile), while some aspects of the code are not (i.e. the Go source).
- Setting up CI/CD...
- TODO: Fill in this list more comprehensively.

## Description

Web wrapper around youtube-dl.

Safe way for family to download videos.

## Learning

What am I most interested in learning with this project?

- Writing quality unit and integration tests in Golang.
- Deploying app e2e using Packer, Terraform, etc... (or k8s potentially...)
  - Ideally would like to have some version of this application deployed as soon
    as possible.
- Coding experience in Golang... i.e. write lots of code.
  - Specifically concurrent code
